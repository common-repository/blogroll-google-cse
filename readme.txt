A plugin that uses links stored in to the blogroll to dynamically create a Google CSE.

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin I’ve written with the co-operation of the kind folks at the [Libraries Interact](http://librariesinteract.info/) blog makes it possible to take links listed in your Blogroll, using the [Links Manager](http://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager), and create a [Google Custom Search Engine](http://www.google.com/coop/cse/) (CSE) automatically.

Features of the plugin include:

* Grouping links into categories
* Distinguishing between links that are considered “live” and those that are “abandoned”
* Control over the text displayed to the user for various user interface elements
* Managing the colour of elements in the CSE search results display

The plugin is currently in use by the [Libraries Interact](http://librariesinteract.info/) blog to power the list of blogs on the [Aussie Library Blogs](http://librariesinteract.info/australian-library-blogs/) page.

Latest Updates:

* Compatibility updates for WordPress 2.7
* Add optional link to plugin page when list of links is displayed

Known Issues:

* The Google CSE search form will only work if you're using permalinks
